# How to contribute

## Development Environment

Libram is primarily developed on Linux. To develop libram on Windows, we recommend using WSL.

libram uses Yarn classic. We intend to eventually move to Yarn v2, but there are no solid plans yet.

You can use any editor for development. If you are uncertain, we recommend using Visual Studio Code.
